# How to translate

## zeta resource editor

The folder structure for this localization is the same as everything else in the project folder.

The name of the localization file should be the same as the original, excluding the extension (.razor.cs) and with the language (.en-US.resx)

https://www.zeta-resource-editor.com can be used to edit all files and make sure everything is translated.

This program does not detect new localization files, don't forget to add those.
